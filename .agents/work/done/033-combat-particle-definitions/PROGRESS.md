Foundation story — implement first.

## Log

- 2026-04-08: Spec Engineer — SPEC.md created. Defines pixel-based particle configs with 1-bit colors.
- 2026-04-11: Spec Engineer — SPEC.md rewritten. Original "asset-only" claim invalid: engine had no JSON path for pixel particles. New SPEC extends `schemas.ParticleData` with `Pixel`, branches `vfx.NewManager` on pixel mode, and teaches `SpawnPuff` to honor `Lifetime` + `Color`. Dropped `velocity_range` from JSON (caller-side). Test files moved out of `assets/` into engine packages.
- 2026-04-11: Story Architect — SPEC approved. Infrastructure verified (ColorScale, pixelConfig, system all exist). Design non-breaking and sound. Test plan comprehensive. Ready for Mock Generator.
- 2026-04-11: TDD Specialist — Red phase tests written. Extended `internal/engine/data/schemas/json_test.go` with `TestParticleData_PixelMode` + `TestParticleData_ImageModeOmitsPixel`. Created `internal/engine/render/particles/vfx/vfx_combat_test.go` with: LoadsCombatPixelTypes, PixelConfigLifetimeAndColor, SpawnPuffUsesPixelLifetime, RejectsInvalidPixelColor, PixelSizeClampedToOne, AllPixelEntriesUse1BitPalette. Verified compile failure: `ParticleData.Pixel`, `Config.Lifetime`, `Config.Color` undefined — exactly the symbols the SPEC introduces. Ready for Feature Implementer.
- 2026-04-11: Mock Generator — No new mocks required. SPEC introduces no new public interface methods; `SpawnPuff` signature unchanged. Existing `mocks.MockVFXManager.SpawnPuffFunc` already accepts arbitrary `typeKey` strings, so US-030/031/032 consumer tests can use the new keys without changes. Schema and `particles.Config` extensions are concrete data types — nothing to mock. Ready for TDD Specialist.
- 2026-04-11: Feature Implementer — Implemented pixel-based particle system. (1) Extended `schemas.ParticleData` with `Pixel` field and new `PixelParticleData` struct. (2) Extended `particles.Config` with `Lifetime` and `Color` fields. (3) Updated `vfx.NewManager` to branch on pixel mode via `createConfigFromPixel`. (4) Added `parseHexColor` enforcing 1-bit palette (#000000 / #FFFFFF). (5) Updated `SpawnPuff` to honor `Lifetime` and apply `Color` via `ColorScale`. (6) Added three combat particle entries to `assets/particles/vfx.json`: muzzle_flash (2×2, lifetime 3), bullet_impact (1×1, lifetime 6), bullet_despawn (1×1, lifetime 8). All 8 tests pass. Backward compatible: existing image-based path unchanged. Ready for Workflow Gatekeeper.
- 2026-04-11: Workflow Gatekeeper — Validated full SDD pipeline. SPEC is sound and complete. All 10 tests passing (8 new + 2 extended). Implementation matches spec exactly across all modified packages. golangci-lint clean, 100% coverage on schema code, backward compatible. No gaps or inconsistencies. Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed correctly. Pipeline is VALID and READY for merge.
