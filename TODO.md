# Firefly Game Boilerplate Development Plan

## üéØ HIGH PRIORITY - Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Game State Management

...

### 2. Audio System

- Implement sound effects and background music
- Add audio asset loading and management
- Create audio configuration system

### 3. Enemy AI System

- Basic AI behaviors (patrol, chase, avoid)
- Enemy movement patterns and pathfinding
- Enemy-player interaction system

### 4. UI/HUD System

- Health bars, score display, menus
- Button system with click handling
- Text rendering and font management

## üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY - Game Systems

### 5. Scoring & Progression System

- Points system with high scores
- Level progression mechanics
- Achievement system

### 6. Collectibles System

- Interactive items (coins, power-ups)
- Item effects and behaviors
- Collection feedback and animations

### 7. Enhanced Animation System

- Sprite interpolation and easing
- Complex animation sequences
- Animation state management

### 8. Camera System

- Camera following and zoom
- World scrolling for larger maps
- Viewport management

## üé® LOWER PRIORITY - Polish & Advanced Features

### 9. Enhanced Input System

- Profiling and debugging tools

## üèóÔ∏è FUTURE - Framework Conversion (Not Priority)

### 15. Framework Core Abstraction

- Create reusable framework interfaces
- Entity-component system
- Plugin architecture

### 16. Framework Systems

- Asset management system
- Event/messaging system
- Configuration management

### 17. Developer Experience

- Public API design
- Documentation and tutorials
- Example games and templates

### 18. Framework Distribution

- Version management strategy
- Update workflow design
- Community tools and support

## Current Status

‚úÖ Basic player movement and physics  
‚úÖ Collision detection system  
‚úÖ Sprite animation (idle/walk)  
‚úÖ Input handling (keyboard)  
‚úÖ Boundary and obstacle system

## Next Focus

üéØ **Start with Game State Management**

- This provides the foundation for all other systems and creates a proper game structure.
